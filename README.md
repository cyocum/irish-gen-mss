# Early Irish Genealogy Database Manuscript Transcription Archive

This is the Manuscript Transcription Archive for the [Early Irish
Genealogy Database](https://github.com/cyocum/irish-gen).  The purpose
is to supply transcriptions from MSS which are available on [Irish
Scripts on Screen](https://www.isos.dias.ie/) that have large amounts
of early Irish genealogical material to allow the translation of
those sources into RDF for the IrishGen database.

## Format

The format for the transcriptions is [TEI XML](http://www.tei-c.org/).
These can be translated into HTML for ease of human consumption using
the [TEI Stylesheets](https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets).
